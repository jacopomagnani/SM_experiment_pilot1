<p>
    This experiment will consist of <b>two parts</b>.
</p>

<p>
    At the end of the experiment, you will be paid {{ fee }}, plus earnings based on the points you have earned during the experiment.
    The computer will calculate your average score in Part 1 and your average score in Part 2 and sum them up.
    This value will then be converted at an exchange rate of AED{{rate_value}} per point and rounded to the nearest integer.
    To sum up, your final payment is given by the following formula:
    <center>
    <em>
        {{fee}}  <span>+</span>  AED{{rate_value}} <span>&times;</span> (your average score in Part 1  <span>+</span>  your average score in Part 2)
    </em>
    </center>
</p>
<br>
<p class="a">
    Note: in the unlikely event that the sum of your average scores in Part 1 and Part 2 is negative, you will earn {{fee}}.
