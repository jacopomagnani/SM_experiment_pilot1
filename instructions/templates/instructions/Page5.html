<p>
    <ul>
    <li>In each round, each participant is assigned a number, which we will call the participant's <b>multiplier</b>.</li>
    <li>In each round, to determine a participantâ€™s multiplier the <b>computer will randomly select a number between 2 and 10</b>.
        Each value between 2 and 10 is equally likely to be selected.</li>
    <li>Note also that the multiplier of each participant is independent from the multipliers of others.</li>
    <li>Each player knows his or her multiplier. Players have <b>no information about the multipliers of others</b>.</li>
    </ul>
