<p>
    <ul>
    <li>In this experiment, you earn points by pairing with other players.</li>
    <li>Each player is assigned a value and the points you earn when you form a pair depend both your own value and the value of your partner.</li>
    <li>You cannot directly choose your partner.
        However, if you wish, you can try to influence the way in which you are paired to others by submitting a bid, which is subtracted from your final points.</li>
    </ul>
