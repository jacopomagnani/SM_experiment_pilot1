    <p>
        You will now play one practice round.
    </p>
    <p>
        This round is identical to the actual rounds except that:
        <ul>
        <li>during the practice round you will only interact with the computer, not with other participants, and the computer will make random choices;</li>
        <li>points you make in the practice round do not count for your final earnings.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
