<p>
    Player B bid 6 and the other players in his group bid 10 and 8.
    Thus, player B is the lowest bidder in his group.
</p>
<p>
    In Group 2, all the three players bid the same value.
    Therefore, the computer will randomly determine the ranking of their bids.
</p>
<p>
    If the computer determines D is the lowest bidder in his group, then player B will be paired with player D and his score will be:
</p>
<p class="c">
    (B's multiplier)<span>&times;</span>(D's multiplier)<span>&minus;</span>(B's bid) = 3<span>&times;</span>2<span>&minus;</span>6 = 6-6=0
</p>
<p>
    If the computer determines E is the lowest bidder in his group, then player B will be paired with player E and his score will be:
</p>
<p class="c">
    (B's multiplier)<span>&times;</span>(E's multiplier)<span>&minus;</span>(B's bid) = 3<span>&times;</span>4<span>&minus;</span>6 = 12-6=6
</p>
<p>
    If the computer determines F is the lowest bidder in his group, then player B will be paired with player F and his score will be:
</p>
<p class="c">
    (B's multiplier)<span>&times;</span>(F's multiplier)<span>&minus;</span>(B's bid) = 3<span>&times;</span>10<span>&minus;</span>6 = 30-6=24
</p>
<p>
    Thus, player B may earn any of these three scores, depending on the random choice of the computer.
