<p>
    Player B bid 0 and the other players in his group bid 0 and 15. Player C is the highest bidder.
    Players A and B bid the same value and therefore the computer will randomly determine who is the second-highest bidder and who is the lowest bidder.
</p>
<p>
    In Group 2, the highest bidder is player E, the second-highest bidder is player F and the lowest bidder is player D.
</p>
<p>
    If the computer determines B is the second-highest bidder in his group, then he will be paired with player F and his score will be:
</p>
<p class="c">
    (B's multiplier)<span>&times;</span>(F's multiplier)<span>&minus;</span>(B's bid) = 2<span>&times;</span>7<span>&minus;</span>0 = 14-0=14
</p>
<p>
    If the computer determines B is the lowest bidder in his group, then he will be paired with player D and his score will be:
</p>
<p class="c">
    (B's multiplier)<span>&times;</span>(D's multiplier)<span>&minus;</span>(B's bid) = 2<span>&times;</span>5<span>&minus;</span>0 = 10-0=10
</p>
<p>
    Thus, player B may earn either of these two scores, depending on the random choice of the computer.
    However, player B has no chance to earn 4 points.
    That would happen only if he was ranked at the top and paired with player E.
