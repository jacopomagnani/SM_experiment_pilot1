    <p>
        You will now begin part 2.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Part 2 you will play the same game you have played in Part 1 for 5 rounds.
        Your final payment will depend on the points you have earned in Part 2, averaged across all the rounds of Part 2.
        At the end of the experiment, the computer will calculate your average score in Part 2 and convert it at an exchange rate of AED{{rate_value}} per point.
        Before the first round of Part 2, you and all the other participants in your market are asked to respond to a survey in the next page.
